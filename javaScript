What are the four principles of OOP?
The four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods together.
Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
Inheritance – Deriving new classes from existing ones.
Polymorphism – One interface, multiple implementations.


What is final keyword, and how does it work?
✅ Answer:
The final keyword prevents class inheritance and method overriding.

 What is an interface, and how is it different from an abstract class?
✅ Answer:
An interface defines method signatures without implementation. A class implementing an interface must define all its methods.

interface Animal {
    public function makeSound();
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Bark";
    }
}
